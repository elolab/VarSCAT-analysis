The original data was downloaded from https://www.internationalgenome.org/, http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000_genomes_project/release/20190312_biallelic_SNV_and_INDEL/

Under each per-chromosome folder, it should contain the original VCF file of that chromosome
1. Break the per chromosome coordination (hg38, UCSC Genome Browser) onto sub-regions (*_index)
2. Ran Exract_AF.sh and parallel_chr*_extract_sample_GP.sh to extract allele frequency and genotype of each variant from original VCF file. 
3. Ran No_GP_VCF_index_chr1.sh to create VCF file without genotype columns to reduce the memory intake of inputs 
4. Ran VarSCAT_parallel_chr1_run.sh to get annotation results from VarSCAT
5. The "per-sub-region" files will be combine back to "the-whole-chromosome" in following analysis sections

Due to Github can not hold large files, the more details analysis codes can be found at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7018364
