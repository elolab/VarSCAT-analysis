The original VCF files were first fileter and only kept indels. (VCFtools - 0.1.17, --recode-INFO-all, --keep-only-indels, --recode)
The normalized VCF for UPS-indel were produced by: 
    gatk LeftAlignAndTrimVariants --split-multi-allelics
    vt normalize
Due to UPS-indel cannot handle file with chromosome string "chr", so we used "awk '{gsub(/\chr/, "")}1'" to manully change the chromosome string.
